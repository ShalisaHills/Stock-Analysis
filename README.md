# **Stock-Analysis**
## Module 2 VBA

###**Overview of Project** 
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze various green energy stocks to ensure that Steve's parents were making the correct decision to invest in DAQO (DQ) New Energy Corp. In an effort to assist with the analysis we will use VBA to automate the task of the analysis. VBA is a programing language that can read and write code in excel.  By leveraging VBA we reduce the chance of errors and the code can be reused for future stock analysis. 

###**Results** 
**Stock Comparison**
In 2017, DQ stock return was 199.4% this was the highest return compared to all the other green energy stocks within the analysis.  SEDG was the second highest preforming stock at 184.5% with ENPH placing third at 129.5% return.

In 2018, DQ stock plummeted to a -62.6% return, SEDG dropped to -7.8% but ENPH held strong at a 81.9% return.  2018 in general was a bad year for the green energy stocks analyzed.  All stocks except for RUN had decrease.  RUN increased by 79%.  The stock market is volitale the fluctuation could just be normal ebs and flows of the stock market. However, I would propose investing a portion in RUN as it is gradually growning.

**Refactoring**
Prior to refactoring the code the can ran over 3 seconds for both 2017 & 2018 data.  Once the code was refactored the time dropped to less than one second for both analysis.

###**Summary** 
In summary, the advantages of refactoring code is that it optimizes and restructures the existing code without changing the logic.  Refactoring can identify bugs within the code prior to pushing it production or making it available for use.  Once the code was refactored for the VBA challenge it ran faster although I thought three seconds was pretty fast; I understand why you want to optimize the code as much as possible.  I was reading up on refactoring code and one of the disadvantages mentioned was delivery deadline is near and new development is plannced.  Refactoring could potentially delay a project or if you dont have time to thoroughly test the refactored code.  Overall I think the pro's outweigh the cons and being someone new to "coding" refactoring will aid in identifying issues with my code.  Its somewhat of a peer review.
