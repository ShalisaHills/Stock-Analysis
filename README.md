# **Stock-Analysis**
## Module 2 VBA

###**Overview of Project** 
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze various green energy stocks to ensure that Steve's parents were making the correct decision to invest in DAQO (DQ) New Energy Corp. In an effort to assist with the analysis we will use VBA to automate the task of the analysis. VBA is a programing language that can read and write code in excel.  By leveraging VBA we reduce the chance of errors and the code can be reused for future stock analysis.
